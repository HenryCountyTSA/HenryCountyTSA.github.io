      <h1 class="heading">Augmented Reality in Architecture</h1>
      <p>The amount of potential for augmented reality(AR) in architecture is endless. A computer generated model of projects present a drastic change to how architects and civil engineers conduct their business. Whether it’s relaying messages to another team member, projecting visual images, or running simulations in an area, augmented technology presents consumers a groundbreaking way to evolve. </p>
      <p> Once AR evolves and becomes integrated into the world of architecture, our ability to create will drastically change.  No longer will we have to mentally visualize what our drawing or sketch will look like. With several pieces of software such as CAD, 3D modeling and interior design will flourish. Architects will be able to effectively scale several aspects of the project and capture existing site conditions, topography, and lighting conditions. This will also allow consumers to design the interior of a building and give them more creative control.  In addition to 3D modeling, we’ll have the opportunity to be immersed into a design before it’s even built. With several functions, including animations and simulations, the attention to detail will be greater than ever. The infrastructure of a building, including the pipelines and wiring, will easily be accessible to anyone making repairs, or for those building an efficient design. The ability to be immersed into a design gives architects a better understanding of the environment and the changes necessary to make the project successful. Architects and engineers will be able to work together to efficiently design and realistically visualize a project. The expanding market of augmented technology will present even more possibilities in the near future. Society's creative potential will exceed the limits of the past. </p>
