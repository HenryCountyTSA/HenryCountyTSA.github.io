    <h1 class="heading"> Concerns of Augmented Reality </h1>
    <p>The expanding involvement of Augmented Reality has an impact on society as a whole. The rapid progression of technology may have the ability to provide our society with an abundance of benefits, but it can also impact us in a negative way. As Augmented Reality floods mainstream culture, so do the concerns and potential dangers that it poses. AR can affect our senses through everyday activities. With consistent use of it, our ability to perceive the daily norm may be hindered. Projections through AR can present a distraction, and hurt our ability to react in situations. It also takes a toll on the eyes as prolonged use may strain them along with other side effects. Impairment of our vision due to wearable AR devices can cause immediate concern for how the devices should be designed, or the amount of time they should be used. </p> 
    <p>In addition to the impairment of our vision and senses, Augmented Reality presents an issue with security and bugs within the system. As with most computing devices, private information within the device could be accessed in public environments. Information regarding location, pictures, or even conversations are vulnerable to being leaked. It becomes a known issue when our privacy becomes non-existent due to the room of error within the tech. As apps continue to be published for these devices, the potential security breach becomes imminent. If society relies on the use of Augmented Reality too much, this potential harm can make a huge impact on the market, especially if one incident were to occur. Fear not though, counter measures for these issues can certainly be implemented. As consumers, we must simply take caution of the ever-evolving world of augmented technology.</p>
