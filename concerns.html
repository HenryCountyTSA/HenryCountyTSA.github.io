    <h1 class="heading"> Concerns of Augmented Reality </h1>
    <p> The expanding involvement of augmented reality has an impact on society as a whole. The rapid progression of technology may have the ability to provide society with an abundance of benefits, but it can also have a negative impact. As augmented reality floods mainstream culture, so do the concerns and potential dangers that it poses. AR can affect a person’s senses through everyday activities. With consistent use, the ability to perceive the daily norm may be hindered. Projections through AR can present a distraction and hurt anyone’s ability to react in situations. It also takes a toll on the eyes as prolonged use may strain them, along with other side effects. Impairment of the vision due to wearable AR devices can cause immediate concern for how the devices should be designed, or the amount of time they should be used. </p>
    <p> In addition to the impairment of a person’s vision and senses, augmented reality presents an issue surrounding security and defects within a computing system. As with most computing devices, private information within the device could be accessed in public environments. Information regarding location, pictures, or even conversations are vulnerable to being leaked. It becomes a problem when society’s privacy becomes non-existent due to the room of error within the technology. As apps continue to be published for these devices, the potential security breach becomes imminent. If society relies on the use of augmented technology too much, the potential harm can make a huge impact on the market, especially if one incident were to occur. Fear not though, counter measures for these issues can certainly be implemented. Consumers must simply take caution of the ever-evolving world of augmented technology. </p>
