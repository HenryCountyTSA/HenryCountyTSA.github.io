    <h1 class="heading"> Augmented Reality in Entertainment </h1>
  <p> Augmented Reality has split into two areas in entertainment. One is the use of headsets for gaming and the other is the use of phone cameras to seemingly distort reality. Examples of these are Microsoft’s Hololens, a product that you wear on your head and look through that displays information and games with a very sci-fi feel, and Niantic Labs’ Pokémon Go, a mobile game that lets you see and capture Pokémon in the real world. </p>
  <p> Many tech news sources call Microsoft’s Hololens, “the future of computing.” It works by displaying “holograms” onto its screens and by using cameras and microphones to take inputs from the user. Interacting with the holograms is fairly simple with voice commands and gesture controls. The Hololens was clearly designed for usage by people as it is fairly comfortable to wear, and only slightly interrupts your upper peripherals. Also, it isn’t cheaply designed, so with the hefty price you’re paying for it, a whopping $3,000, you will get a great product. The Hololens can put a wireframe mesh around real world objects so you can clearly see what is real and what is not. The only experiences people have had with them is at beta tests for the product, so it will inevitably be even better by the time it is released. </p>
  <p> Pokémon Go is a free-to-play, location-based augmented reality game developed by Niantic. In the game, players use a mobile device's GPS capability to locate, capture, battle, and train Pokémon who appear on the screen as if they were in the same location as the user. </p>
