	<h3> What is Augmented Reality? </h3>
	<p> AR technology enhances the physical environment you see by overlaying virtual elements, such as information or images over it. This is done through displays such as HoloLens and Google Glass or through the camera view on your smartphone and tablet. Unlike virtual reality, which immerses you into a different environment, AR has the ability to overlay virtual content on the physical world and have the two interact simultaneously in real time. The technology allows you to view holograms and manipulate 3D models for various purposes. </p>
	<h3> How it Began </h3>
    <p> The first AR technology was developed in 1968 at Harvard when computer scientist Ivan Sutherland created an AR head-mounted display system. The system used computer-generated graphics to show users simple wireframe drawings. The technologies development continued in 1974 when Myron Krueger built an ‘artificial laboratory’ called the Videoplace. The invention combined projectors with video cameras that emitted onscreen silhouettes, surrounding users in an interactive environment. Augmented technology continued to be developed by companies and agencies for wearables and digital displays. </p>
    <p> The term “augmented reality” was officially coined in 1990 by Boeing engineer Tom Caudell, with the definition being: “the interaction of superimposed graphics, audio and other sense enhancements over a real-world environment that’s displayed in real-time.” The next step in augmented reality was Virtual Fixtures, first designed in 1992 by Louis Rosenberg for the US Air Force. Its purpose was to allow the Air Force to control virtually guided machinery to perform tasks from a remote location. “Dancing in Cyberspace” was an augmented reality theatrical production that was created in 1994 by Julie Martin, and it was the first of its kind.  </p>
    <p> Eventually, augmented reality makes its way into entertainment. The 1st and ten line computer system is used to cast a visual first down marker during a live NFL game. In 1999, the NASA X-38 spacecraft is flown using a Hybrid Synthetic Vision system to overlap map data to provide enhanced visual navigation during flight tests. In 2000, Hirokazu Kato created the ARToolKit, an open source software library that uses video tracking to overlay computer graphics on a video camera. Even to this day, the ARToolKit is commonly used to compliment augmented reality experiences. </p>
    <p> In time, AR hardware and software make the leap toward consumer audiences. Companies began advertising their products through projected models for consumers to observe. This marketing strategy was implemented with the idea that consumers will be engaged at public events. The Volkswagen MARTA app was released in 2013 to provide a virtual step-by-step repair assistance, allowing service technicians to foresee the repair process. Products such as the Google Glass and HoloLens is released to the public for more practical and educational purposes. It allows people to display information in a hands-free format. These two devices helped promote the trend of wearable AR devices as well. In 2016, augmented reality and virtual reality investment reaches $1.1 billion. </p>
