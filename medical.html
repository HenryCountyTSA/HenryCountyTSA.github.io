        <p> The expansion of Augmented Reality has rapidly increased over the past decade. Augmented Reality projects computer graphics over our natural surroundings to enhance our current applications. With AR quickly entering the mainstream industry, the growth and expansion of it are ascending our daily lives. Soon enough, we’ll find it included along many aspects of our medical field. </p>
    <p> The medical field will always take assistance from technology to benefit the wellbeing of people.The relationship between a patient and a doctor has a potential to grow deeply as we can communicate any issues in a more detailed way through Augmented Reality. It can project simulations for conditions and symptoms we’re experiencing to help pinpoint the area of discomfort. Projections from Augmented Reality allow visualization of areas in our body. For example, our veins can be shown through a projection of Augmented Reality, which allows efficiency for Doctors and Nurses. </p>
    <p> Technology such as AR allow people to have efficient workouts. AR can provide simulations of workouts that provide us the best results.It can also be used to provide projections to enhance our experience and provides us motivation for our physical activities.While it can provide a lot to us physically, it can also provide a deep impact to us mentally.AR can impact medical students greatly in a positive way.AR can display real anatomical models which allows us to inspect how certain functions of our bodies function.In time, it can potentially project live models of our bodies to show infected areas, areas of nerve pain, etc. This provides extensive assistance to students while also providing potential knowledge to enhance the management of our health.The potential of AR technology is endless and, in time, we’ll be able to use it effectively for the benefit of medical advancement and treatment. </p>
