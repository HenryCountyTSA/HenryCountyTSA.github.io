    <p>Augmented Reality overlays projections over real life objects in our daily lives. AR is constantly on the rise in our daily lives. The advancement of Augmented Reality could potentially change the way we progress in our research. It allows us to potentially change the way we efficiently build technology, examine patients, and observe the natural surroundings of earth. AR will allow our future scientists to take advantage of technology, so that we can grasp the potential we have to work with the natural behaviors of the environment.</p>
    <p> The possibilities of connecting AR with science are endless. We can fully utilize this technology for several areas in the field. It has the capabilities to project elements in front of us. With this, we are able to visualize the bonding and reaction of several elements. Along with the study of elements, we’re allowed to observe natural habitats of animals. Projections of these habitats will allow us to run simulations for climate change due to certain conditions. It’ll allow us to predict changes of the environment due to a lack of resources and food more efficiently. The idea of running simulations can benefit our everyday lives in many ways. By visually seeing the results of initial testings in front of us, we’re able to refine anything that is needed to save people time and money. These two areas can quickly benefit the education of students. Visually, we’ll be able to show students from a young age and even later on, a more entertaining and informative way of learning.</p>
    <p> The education of science and the medical field are able to coincide in the future with the assistance of AR. With the study of the natural body, we’re able to problem solve areas of damage to the body. We can design medical assisting technology to benefit others in several ways.  We can also use AR to study astronomy. We can potentially learn and interact with several aspects of our spacecraft and the solar system. Whatever the area may be, AR technology can be utilized for the better of our earth. With science and AR combined, the possibilities are endless. </p>
