    <p> Several connections can be made between augmented reality and science. The tech itself is capable of changing the way research is conducted. Consumers and scientists can fully utilize the technology for several areas in the field. One area involves educating students. An app called Elements 4D utilizes augmented technology by projecting various chemical reactions. With this, students are able to visualize the bonding and reaction of several elements. AR can also be used to study astronomy and NASA’s spacecraft. With the application, NASA’s Spacecraft 3D, students can view animations of several spacecraft and how they work. The app also features interesting engineering feats that provide insight on the discoveries in space. Visually, teachers will be able to show students from a young age and even later on, a more entertaining and informative way of learning. </p>
	<p> Along with the study of elements, AR can be incredibly valuable for exploring various cultural, historical, and geographic aspects of an environment. Projections of these environments will help run simulations for climate change due to certain conditions. These projections allow studies to predict any changes in the environment due to a lack of resources more efficiently. By visually seeing the results of experiments, scientists are able to refine anything that is needed to improve the natural surroundings and save time.  Augmented technology may be used for more practical purposes at home as well. When a piece of hardware fails in electronic devices, AR based applications can pinpoint the part that is malfunctioning. This allows consumers to identify the issue quickly, while saving time and money on resolving it. Wherever the area may be, scientific advancements are bound to expand with the help of augmented technology. </p>
