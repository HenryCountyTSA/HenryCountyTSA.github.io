    <h2> Mission Statement </h2>
      <p>The Technology Student Association enhances personal development, leadership, and career opportunities in STEM, whereby members apply and integrate these concepts through intracurricular activities, competitions, and related programs.</p>
    <h2> The Technology Student Association's Motto </h2>
      <p>Learning to lead in a technical world</p>
    <h2> The Technology Student Association's Creed </h2>
      <p>I believe that Technology Education holds an important place in my life in the technical world. I believe there is a need for the development of good attitudes concerning work, tools, materials, experimentation, and processes of industry. Guided by my teachers, artisans from industry, and my own initiative, I will strive to do my best in making my school, community, state, and nation better places in which to live. I will accept the responsibilities that are mine. I will accept the theories that are supported by proper evidence. I will explore on my own for safer, more effective methods of working and living. I will strive to develop a cooperative attitude and will exercise tact and respect for other individuals. Through the work of my hands and mind, I will express my ideas to the best of my ability. I will make it my goal to do better each day the task before me, and to be steadfast in my belief in my God, and my fellow Americans.</p>

    <h4> Bio: </h4>
    <p> Mr. Holcomb is a graduate of Henry County High School, class of 2006. Afterwards, he represented our school well by continuing his education with Northern Kentucky University and Gateway Community and Technical College, located in Florence, KY. During and after his tenure at Gateway, Mr. Holcomb worked as a computer technician and assistant network administrator for LeanCor Supply Chain Group. After 2 ½ years of performing these duties, he felt the need to move back to his hometown of Henry County. It just so happened that the Henry County school district had an opening for the computer technician role. Mr. Holcomb was offered the job and worked it to his fullest extent for 2 years. During this time, he began to cultivate relationships with faculty as well as the students. Therefore, when a position at the high school opened for CIT instructor, they had one man in mind. That man was Mr. Holcomb. After a month of debating whether or not he could successfully prepare students for their future in technology, Mr. Holcomb accepted the role and began his task of transforming the culture of Henry County’s IT program. Nearing the end of his 1st full school year with Henry County, Mr. Holcomb is happy with his decision to teach, and is extremely excited for the future of the program. </p>

Though I have held several different titles (Industrial arts teacher, Technology Teacher, Engineering Technology Teacher) the job has remained the same. I still refuse to call myself a teacher, I prefer the title “Learning Assistant”. I have been in KY for the past 12 years and fallen in the love with this state. I previously taught for 6 years in upstate NY." </p>
